Description:
  Short: offers standard alternatives to Praat's native colour format
  Long: >
    Praat uses a rather unorthodox approach to define colours: red, green and
    blue components have to be provided in a scale from 0 to 1, in which 0
    equals to absense of a component.

    This plugin offers conversions from standard colour formatting to Praat's
    idiosyncratic format. In particular, this plugin parses hexadecimal, RGB
    and HSV formats. To do so, it uses a series of procedures to convert
    hexadecimal and HSV formats into RGB, and then from RGB to Praat's format.

    When the plugin is installed, several new commands become available in the
    Picture window, under the World and Pen menu. These commands can be used
    manually or they can be intergrated directly into scripts by the means of
    runScript.

    Besides the colour formatting, these new commands receive the same
    arguments than the original commands it aims to emulate.
