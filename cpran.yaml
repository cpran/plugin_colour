Description:
  Short: convert standard colour formats to Praat's
  Long: >
    Praat uses a rather unorthodox approach to define colours: red, green and
    blue components have to be provided in a scale from 0 to 1, in which 0
    equals to absense of a component.

    This plugin offers conversions from standard colour formatting to Praat's
    idiosyncratic format. In particular, this plugin parses hexadecimal, RGB
    and HSV formats. To do so, it uses a series of procedures to convert
    hexadecimal and HSV formats into RGB, and then from RGB to Praat's format.

    When the plugin is installed, three new commands become available in the
    Picture window, under the Pen menu. These commands can be used manually or
    they can be intergrated directly into scripts by the means of runScript.

    Once any of these scripts has been executed, the colour defined by the
    user can be used in any of the contexts where the command Colour... works.
